This repository holds codes and data used to produce results for the paper entitled "Stylized least-cost analysis of flexible nuclear power in deeply decarbonized electricity systems considering wind and solar resources worldwide" (Duan et al. 2022), which is now published on Nature Energy.

Current PGP cost has been reduced substantially compared to previous estimate when this analysis started. 

For example:

(1) the updated fixed cost for the electrolyzer plant is $0.023/kW, about 66% of what was used in the analysis;

(2) the updated fixed cost for the fuel cell is $0.023/kW, about 40% of what was used in the analysis. 

To reflect such changes and examine cost reduction in PGP on our simulation results, we re-conducted simulations for the six selected regions including the updated PGP cost, under various emission reduction constriants. 

The updated PGP cost estimates, and corresponding simulation results can be found under the folder "Cheaper_PGP_Analysis".
